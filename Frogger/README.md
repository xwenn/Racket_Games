### Gameplay

The goal of the game is to direct a frog from the botton of the screen to the top of the scree by crossing a busy road and navigating a river. The frog has three lives at the begining of the game. The player must achieve the goal before the score is deducted to zero.

1. Being hit by or running into a road vehicle
2. Jumping into the river's water
3. Running off the side of the screen
