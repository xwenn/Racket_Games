# Frogger

### Gameplay

The goal of the game is to direct a frog from the botton of the screen to the top of the scree by crossing a busy road and navigating a river. The frog has three lives at the begining of the game. The player must achieve the goal before the score is deducted to zero.

Ways to lose a frog life:
1. Being hit by or running into a road vehicle
2. Jumping into the river's water
3. Running off the side of the screen

### Scoring

The game starts with a score of 500 points. Score will be deducted at the rate of 5 points/second, and when a frog life loses, 100 points will be deducted from the score.
